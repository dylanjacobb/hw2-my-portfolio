# hw2-my-portfolio

## **Project Description**
For this project we were asked to create our own portfolio for potential employeer's so they would be able to see what kind of work we did and if we'd be a good fit for the position they had open.

Here's the link to my portfolio website: https://dylanjacobb.github.io/hw2-my-portfolio/

Here's a few screenshots of the final webpage:

<!-- AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position -->

<!-- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport -->
